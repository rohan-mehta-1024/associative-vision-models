# associative-vision-models

Trying to improve Apple's Face Recognition by making it possible for a model to recognize someone while masked and unmasked with no extra training data. Basic idea is to use an instance of a Universal Hopfield Network (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04557) to store memories of unmasked faces.

Code in this repository is not updated often. Will be properly updated once project concludes.
